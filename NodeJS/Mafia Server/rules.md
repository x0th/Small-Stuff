# Rules of Mafia
## Start of the game
Everybody are assigned a role. There are 2 Mafias, 1 Sheriff and 4 Citizens, a total of 7 players. Each player only sees their role.

## Night
* Mafias choose who to kill.
	* Killed people will not be able to take any actions starting from the next day.
	* If 2 Mafias vote for different people, one of them is chosen at random. Thus collaboration is important.
	* If Mafias don't vote, a random person is chosen to be killed.

* Sheriff chooses who to check.
	* The goal of the sheriff is to find all the Mafias. He is on the side of Citizens.
	* At the start of next day, the game will say if a Sheriff found Mafia last night or not. No names given.
	* If a Sheriff does not vote, a random person is chosen.

* Citizens wait.

## Day
Everybody discusses what happened during the nights and choose who to vote out. The goal of Citizens (including Sheriff) is to vote out Mafias, the goal of Mafias is to not show their role and not to be voted out.

## End of game
If 2 Mafias were killed/voted out then Citizens win. If 4 Citizens and a Sheriff were killed/voted out Mafia wins.
