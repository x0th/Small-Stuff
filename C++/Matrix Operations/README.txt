This small program was created out of curiosity. When taking a linear algebra course I noticed that operations on matrices are very algorithmical. This led me to a question of how easy it would be to code. C++ was chosen because I wanted to learn it. I do not claim that my algorithms are the best that you can do, this was not the goal. However I did try to optimize things as much as I could.
What you can do:
Add two matrices.
Multiply two matrices.
Multiply a matrix by a scalar.
Find the determinant of a matrix.
Find the inverse of a matrix.
Find Reduced Row-Echelon Form of a matrix.
Find the rank of a matrix.
